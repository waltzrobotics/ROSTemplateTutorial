# ROS Class Design

- can be executed by launch file or rosrun

```
rosrun
```

```
roslaunch 
```

- class design layout of each
- discuss messages and types (briefly)
- python interpreted --> do not need explicit node start example file

This file is to outline the essential components for getting a ROS node setup that has been defined in a developed node object.  

Add more later.
